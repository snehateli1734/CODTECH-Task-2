Overview of the project

Project:  STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

Task-2:  Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average
grade, and display the overall grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA)

Objective:
Build basic programs using fundamental programming constructs like variables, conditional logic, looping, and functions. Work with user input to create fun and interactive programs.

Key activities:
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP enables developers to organize their code into reusable and
independent modules or components, making it easier to manage complex applications.

Technology Used:
Time Complexity: O(n*l), Here n is the number of students and l is the total number of subjects
Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used.

Given different  scored  marks of  students. We need to find a Grade Calculator in Python. The test score is an average of the respective marks scored in assignments, tests, and
lab work. The final test score is assigned using the below formula.
